# GUI Layout Toolbox

GUI Layout Toolbox is a layout manager for creating MATLAB&reg; graphical user interfaces that resize gracefully. The classes supplied can be used in combination to produce virtually any user interface layout.

With GUI Layout Toolbox, you can:
* Arrange MATLAB user interface components horizontally, vertically or in grids
* Mix fixed- and variable-size components
* Resize components interactively by dragging dividers
* Show and hide components using tabs and panels
* Show part of a large component in a scrollable panel

GUI Layout Toolbox supports `figure` (Java graphics system) from MATLAB R2014b, and `uifigure` (JavaScript graphics system) from R2022a :tada:.

## History of the toolbox

This toolbox was created by [David Sampson](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/16247) and [Ben Tordoff](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1297191) from the [Consulting Services](https://www.mathworks.com/services/consulting.html) group at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/).

The toolbox is distributed on [File Exchange](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox).  An [earlier version](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27758-gui-layout-toolbox) for older MATLAB releases :spider_web: is also available.

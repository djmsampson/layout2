# GUI Layout Toolbox

**Version 2.4**

GUI Layout Toolbox is a layout manager for creating MATLAB graphical user interfaces that resize gracefully. The classes supplied can be used in combination to produce virtually any user interface layout.

With GUI Layout Toolbox, you can:
- Arrange MATLAB user interface components horizontally, vertically, or in grids
- Mix fixed and variable-sized components
- Resize components interactively by dragging dividers
- Show and hide components using tabs and panels
- Show part of a large component in a scrollable panel

GUI Layout Toolbox supports `figure` (Java graphics system) from R2014b, and `uifigure` (JavaScript graphics system) from R2022a :tada:.

This toolbox was created by [David Sampson](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/16247) and [Ben Tordoff](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1297191) from the [Consulting Services](https://www.mathworks.com/services/consulting.html) group at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/).

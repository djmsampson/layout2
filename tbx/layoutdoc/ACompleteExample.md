# **Build a Complete Application**

The following example application uses many of the layout features discussed previously in order to create a user interface that scales well when resized. It is not designed to showcase all the layout functionality, but shows how callbacks are added to provide user interaction. It also exemplifies separating the data from the GUI, a fundamental part of creating modular and maintainable applications.

The full application source code is available in `galleryBrowser.m`.

```matlab
edit galleryBrowser 
```

Run the application.

```matlab
galleryBrowser
```

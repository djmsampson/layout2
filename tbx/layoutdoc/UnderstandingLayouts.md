# **Understanding Layouts**

This section describes the purpose and overall design of the layout tools provided by the toolbox. It also contains several examples of creating user interfaces using layouts.

The purpose of a *layout* is to manage the positioning of one or more user interface components. This means that instead of worrying about the exact position of each user interface component, you instead worry about their relative positioning; are they arranged in a vertical list, horizontal list, a grid pattern, etc.

The best way to understand what layouts are and why they are a good user interface design tool is to see some examples. The sections below go through the basics of building an interface using layouts and how to build complex interfaces using them.

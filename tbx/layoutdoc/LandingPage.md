# **GUI Layout Toolbox**

**Version 2.3.9**


GUI Layout Toolbox is a layout manager for creating MATLAB graphical user interfaces that resize gracefully. The classes supplied can be used in combination to produce virtually any user interface layout.

-  Arrange MATLAB user interface components horizontally, vertically, or in grids 
-  Mix fixed and variable\-sized components 
-  Resize components interactively by dragging dividers 
-  Show and hide components using tabs and panels 
-  Show part of a large component in a scrollable panel 

This toolbox was developed by [David Sampson](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/16247) and [Ben Tordoff](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1297191) from the [Consulting Services](https://www.mathworks.com/services/consulting.html) group at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/).

# Positioning Axes

In contrast to most user interface control objects, such as buttons or dropdown menus, [`axes`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/axes.html) objects have multiple position properties: `Position/InnerPosition` and `OuterPosition`. This means that we have some extra options as to how the layout will arrange the axes. Note that the same options apply to other types of axes, including polar axes ([`polaraxes`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/polaraxes.html)) and geographic axes ([`geoaxes`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/geoaxes.html)).

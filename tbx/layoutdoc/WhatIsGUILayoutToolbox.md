# What is GUI Layout Toolbox?

GUI Layout Toolbox provides a toolbox of MATLAB&reg; classes that allow for complex arrangement of graphical user interface elements within a figure window. The main capabilities provided are:

- Automatic element arrangement horizontally, vertically, or in grids 
- Ability to specify fixed sizes or resizing weights for each element 
- Ability to nest layouts to produce virtually any element arrangement 
- Divider bars for user resizing of elements 

These element arrangements are designed to match those found as standard in other user interface toolkits such as Java Swing, GTK, QT, etc.

## Installation

GUI Layout Toolbox is provided as a MATLAB toolbox file (`.mltbx`).

For instructions on installing and uninstalling toolboxes, see [Get and Manage Add-Ons](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html) in the MATLAB documentation.

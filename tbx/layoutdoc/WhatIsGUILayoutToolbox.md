# **What is GUI Layout Toolbox?**

GUI Layout Toolbox provides a toolbox of MATLAB classes that allow for complex arrangement of graphical user interface elements within a figure window. The main capabilities provided are:

-  Automatic element arrangement horizontally, vertically, or in grids 
-  Ability to specify fixed sizes or resizing weights for each element 
-  Ability to nest layouts to produce virtually any element arrangement 
-  Divider bars for user\-resizing of elements 

These element arrangements are designed to match those found as standard in other user\-interface toolkits such as Java Swing, GTK, QT, etc.

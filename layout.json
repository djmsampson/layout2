    "Description":"This toolbox provides tools to create sophisticated MATLAB graphical user interfaces that resize gracefully. The classes supplied can be used in combination to produce virtually any user interface layout. \n\n* Arrange MATLAB user interface components horizontally, vertically, or in grids\n* Mix fixed- and variable-size components\n* Resize components interactively by dragging dividers\n* Show and hide components using tabs and panels\n* Show part of a large component in a scrollable panel\n\n This toolbox was developed by David Sampson and Ben Tordoff from the [Consulting Services](http://www.mathworks.com/services/consulting/) group at MathWorks.\n\n This version is for MATLAB R2014b and later. For R2014a and earlier, see [version 1](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27758-gui-layout-toolbox).",
